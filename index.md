## About
I’m a junior mechanical engineering student (minor in electrical and computer engineering) interested in space systems, hands-on experimentation, and applied design. I enjoy building and testing real hardware, communicating results clearly, and learning fast in new technical environments. I’m seeking research roles for Spring 2026 and internship opportunities for Summer 2026.

## Projects (selected)
- Thermal Fatigue of Adhesive Tooling Joints: experimental research and results
- Optical Heart Rate Sensor: circuit design, construction, and validation
