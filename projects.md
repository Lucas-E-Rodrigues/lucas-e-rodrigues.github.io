**What it was:** Experimental study of vacuum integrity and adhesive joint durability for modular, additively manufactured composite tooling under thermal cycling.

**My role:** Planned and executed ASTM-compliant vacuum bag leak testing on thermally cycled samples (up to 350°F) and performed Double Cantilever Beam fracture-toughness testing using a Universal Testing Machine and microscopy; summarized results in a conference poster/presentation.

**Skills:** Experimental design, ASTM test methods, vacuum bagging & leak testing, UTM testing, microscopy, data analysis, technical communication.

**Results:** Identified a 41% performance gap in vacuum integrity between print orientations; presented at Purdue’s Spring Undergraduate Research Conference and scored 21% above the average across judging criteria.

**What it was:** Single-supply (5 V) optical PPG heart-rate sensor targeting 40–200 BPM, producing a 0–5 V digital pulse output and LED indication per beat.

**My role:** Designed and built the full signal chain (IR emitter/phototransistor sensing, single-supply biasing, active high-pass + 2nd-order low-pass filtering, gain stage, and comparator with hysteresis), then debugged and validated performance using AD2 oscilloscope/network tools.

**Skills:** Analog signal conditioning, active filters, single-supply op-amp design, comparator hysteresis, instrumentation/testing, iterative debugging, technical reporting.

**Results:** Measured ~2.662 V DC offset with ~40 mVpp heartbeat ripple at the sensor output, verified filter performance (HP cutoff 40.77 BPM, LP cutoff 217.26 BPM), iterated the cascade to achieve an overall 40.46–200.34 BPM band-pass response, confirmed clean digital pulses + LED indication with ~4.4804 Vpp output.
