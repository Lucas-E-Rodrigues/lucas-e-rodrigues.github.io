# Projects

## Research: Thermal Fatigue of Adhesive Bonding in Modular Additively Manufactured Fiber-Reinforced Composite Tooling
**What it was:** Experimental study of adhesive joint performance under thermal cycling for modular tooling.  
**My role:** Literature review of previous research, experimental setup/testing, data collection, results synthesis and presentation.  
**Skills:** Materials and composites, test planning, data integrity, failure modes, reporting, results communication.  
**Artifacts:** [Poster (PDF)](https://github.com/Lucas-E-Rodrigues/portfolio/blob/main/research-adhesives/PosterForSpringExpo-LucasRodrigues.pdf)

## ECE 20008 Final Project: Optical Heart Rate Sensor
**What it was:** Circuit to measure, filter, and convert an analog heart rate to a digital signal using a finger and only a single 5V supply.
**My role:** Circuit design, building, debugging, testing, documentation, and reporting.  
**Skills:** Circuit validation, measurement, electronics, technical reporting.  
**Artifacts:** [Project Report (PDF)](https://github.com/Lucas-E-Rodrigues/portfolio/blob/main/OpticalHeartRateSensorReport.pdf)
