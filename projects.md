**What it was:** Experimental study of vacuum integrity and adhesive joint durability for modular, additively manufactured composite tooling under thermal cycling.

**My role:** Planned and executed ASTM-compliant vacuum bag leak testing on thermally cycled samples (up to 350°F) and performed Double Cantilever Beam fracture-toughness testing using a Universal Testing Machine and microscopy; summarized results in a conference poster/presentation.

**Skills:** Experimental design, ASTM test methods, vacuum bagging & leak testing, UTM testing, microscopy, data analysis, technical communication.

**Results:** Identified a 41% performance gap in vacuum integrity between print orientations; presented at Purdue’s Spring Undergraduate Research Conference and scored 21% above the average across judging criteria.

**What it was:** Single-supply (5 V) optical PPG heart-rate sensor targeting 40–200 BPM, producing a 0–5 V digital pulse output and LED indication per beat.

**My role:** Designed and built the full signal chain (IR emitter/phototransistor sensing, single-supply biasing, active high-pass + 2nd-order low-pass filtering, gain stage, and comparator with hysteresis), then debugged and validated performance using AD2 oscilloscope/network tools.

**Skills:** Analog signal conditioning, active filters, single-supply op-amp design, comparator hysteresis, instrumentation/testing, iterative debugging, technical reporting.

**Results:** Measured ~2.662 V DC offset with ~40 mVpp heartbeat ripple at the sensor output, verified filter performance (HP cutoff 40.77 BPM, LP cutoff 217.26 BPM), iterated the cascade to achieve an overall 40.46–200.34 BPM band-pass response, confirmed clean digital pulses + LED indication with ~4.4804 Vpp output.

     style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:auto; border-radius:5px; border:2px solid #e6e6e6; margin:12px 0 28px 0;">
**What it was:** Designed a 7-quart aluminum fuel tank system for a Purdue Grand Prix racing kart, featuring a dual quick-release handle mechanism and internal baffling to reduce slosh and improve pit-stop serviceability.

**My role:** Led the design phase for the fuel system subteam and produced the detailed CAD in Fusion 360 (tank geometry, mounts, baffles, and quick-release concept). Created a complete design handoff package (BOM + design intent) for manufacturing and installation by teammates.

**Skills:** CAD (Fusion 360), mechanism design, packaging/constraints-driven design, DFM thinking, fit/interface design, documentation & handoff, team leadership.

**Results:** Targeted ~10% reduction in tank weight and an estimated ~70% reduction in tank-swap time through the quick-release concept; baffle layout designed to improve stability during high-speed cornering.

     style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:auto; border-radius:5px; border:2px solid #e6e6e6; margin:12px 0 28px 0;">
**What it was:** Team design project to develop a compact dishwasher concept for small living spaces, guided by customer requirements, benchmarking, and a selected mechanical concept.

**My role:** Worked in a 4-person team to translate customer needs into engineering requirements, develop and refine the concept, and communicate the design through a final poster and written report.

**Skills:** Requirements engineering, benchmarking, concept development, design tradeoffs, CAD communication, technical writing, teamwork.

**Results:** Delivered a complete concept package (requirements + benchmarking + selected concept) and presented the design at a course showcase.
